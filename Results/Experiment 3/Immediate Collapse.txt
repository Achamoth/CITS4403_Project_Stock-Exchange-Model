Timesteps: 200
Sphere size: 5000
Model: Barabase-Albert

Notes:
-Restricting number of people that can join in one time-step to sphere size/25
-Investors won’t join/leave if they’ve done so within the last 20 time-steps
-20% of investors start off in market
-Probability to join starts off almost 0, and only increases (in first time-step) if other social connections are in the market
